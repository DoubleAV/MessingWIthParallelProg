For submission, you must have only source code and headers and build system support files.

Depending on your build system:
Use make clean or make distclean or remove an out of source build folder.

Test your submission by doing a fresh clone from your master into a temp folder and ensure it builds / runs.
e.g., 
git clone <addr_to_student_work> temp_folder_name

build instructions:

after cd'ing into hw2 directory:
	mkdir build
	cmake ..
	make
	./hw2 $PATH_TO_hpc_#m.csv_FILES

I was not able to get more than two processes working so only two command line arguments are taken.
