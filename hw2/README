For submission, you must have only source code and headers and build system support files.

Depending on your build system:
Use make clean or make distclean or remove an out of source build folder.

Test your submission by doing a fresh clone from your master into a temp folder and ensure it builds / runs.
e.g., 
git clone <addr_to_student_work> temp_folder_name
